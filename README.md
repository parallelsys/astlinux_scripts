# astlinux_scripts
Most of my AstLinux work you will find it here.
The blacklist_dialplan is an example of how you could use the blacklist db
found in AstLinux.

#
The script check_lenny checks for lenny recordings and emails them.
The script runs in the background and sleeps for 30 seconds.

More to come.
